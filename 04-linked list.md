#linked list
linked list => a list consisting of items in which each item knows the location of the next item.
node => an item in a linked list. Each node contains a piece of list data and the location of the next node (item).
link =>(of a node) the location of the next node.
head node =>first node in a linked list
head pointer=> points to the head node

**There are foyr types of Linked List**
- Singly linked lists => A singly linked list is a unidirectional linked list. So, you can only traverse it in one direction, i.e., from head node to tail node.
- Doubly linked lists=> A doubly linked list is a bi-directional linked list. So, you can traverse it in both directions. Unlike singly linked lists, 
- its nodes contain one extra pointer called the previous pointer. This pointer points to the previous node.
- Circular linked lists =>A circular Linked list is a unidirectional linked list. So, you can traverse it in only one direction. But this type of linked list has its last node pointing to the head node. So while traversing,
-  you need to be careful and stop traversing when you revisit the head node.
- Circular doubly linked lists => A circular doubly linked list is a mixture of a doubly linked list and a circular linked list.

#Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency

big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors:

Running Time (also known as time efficiency / complexity)
The amount of time a function needs to complete.

Memory Space (also known as space efficiency / complexity)
The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions.
