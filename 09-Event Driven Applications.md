# Event-Driven Programming
Node. js uses events heavily and it is also one of the reasons why Node. js is pretty fast compared to other similar technologies. As soon as Node starts its server, it simply initiates its variables, declares functions and then simply waits for the event to occur.

In an event-driven application, there is generally a main loop that listens for events, and then triggers a callback function when one of those events is detected.
Although events look quite similar to callbacks, the difference lies in the fact that callback functions are called when an asynchronous function returns its result, whereas event handling works on the observer pattern. The functions that listen to events act as Observers. Whenever an event gets fired, its listener function starts executing

## Review, Research, and Discussion


- Why is access control important?
Access control is important because it is a valuable security technique that can be used to regulate who or what can view or use any given resource. In an I.T security setting this could translate to who can access and edit a particular file, what kinds of equipment can be used or who can access certain devices.
- Describe an application that would need access control?
access control is a fundamental component of data security that dictates who's allowed to access and use company information and resources. Through authentication and authorization, access control policies make sure users are who they say they are and that they have appropriate access to company data.

## Vocabulary Terms

Authorization =>  is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to general information security and computer security, and to access control in particular

Role Based Access Control => role-based access control or role-based security is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users

Capabilities => A capability describes a transferable right to perform one (or more) operations on a given object.
