* Classes => classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data , One way to define a class is using a 
class declaration ,and another way to define a class is class expression.

* express.Router=> Use the express.Router class to create modular, mountable route handlers. A Router instance is a complete middleware
and routing system; for this reason, it is often referred to as a “mini-app”.



**Discussion**

1. Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware

2. True or false: The route handler is middleware? 
3. In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser? after the request and before the response 
5. At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware? 
6. What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response


**Document the following Vocabulary Terms**

Middleware :is a function that executes the lifecycle method to an Express server, and utilizes the request and response cycles.

Request Object:is used to describe an request to a server ,represents the HTTP request 

Response Object: Represents a response from a web request initiated by fetch().

Application Middleware:

Routing Middleware:

Test Driven Development:is a software development method to  test cases before developing the actual code, we have three phases: coding,
testing (in the form of writing unit tests) and design (in the form of refactoring).

Behavioral Testing: is  designed to test an application's behavior from the end user's standpoint.
