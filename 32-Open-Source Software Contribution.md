Contributing to open source projects can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, share, and build experience.

There are plenty of reasons why you should contribute to an open source project, such as
- To improve the software you rely on daily.
- To find a mentor if you need one.
- To learn new skills or improve on existing ones.
- To share your skills.
- To gain a much deeper knowledge about the software you're using.
- To build up your reputation and help grow your career.
- Plus, it's fun and gives you personal satisfaction and hey, you never know who is watching, maybe it's your next employer or partner.

### There are different ways in which you can contribute ,some common contributions can be through: 

- Adding a description to a project's documentation to elaborate on a certain point, mostly referred to as a README file (check this guide on how to write a Good README file).
- Giving guidance on a specific project and how to use it.
- Adding sample output to show how the code works.
- Writing in-depth tutorials for the project.
- Adding translation for a project - A good place to start with this might be with the freeCodeCamp's translation program.
- Answering questions about a project (like on Stack Overflow or Reddit)
- You can offer to mentor another contributor.
- You can fix typos and arrange the project's work folder correctly.

### How to find an Open Source Project to Contribute to
Contributing works on all levels, there is no need to over think how you're gonna do it. Instead think of some of the projects you already use and how you can make 
a change to them or improve on them. Research has shown that around 30% of casual contributions are documentation, typo fixes, or even translations.

### How to choose an Open-Source Project
After you have found the project you want to contribute to, it's time to do a little vetting. Make sure it meets the following criteria so you know it'll be a good
project to work on:

- Check out if it has a license file.
- Check when the last commit was made. This will help you know if the maintainers are active and also give you an estimate on how long it will take to respond to 
- your contribution.
- Look for the number of contributors.
- Check how often people make commits.
