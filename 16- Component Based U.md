 ## React js
 React is a library for building user interfaces. React is not a framework – it's not even exclusive to the web. It's used with other libraries to render
 to certain environments. For instance, React Native can be used to build mobile applications.
 
To build for the web, developers use React in tandem with ReactDOM. React and ReactDOM are often discussed in the same spaces as — and utilized to solve 
the same problems as — other true web development frameworks. When we refer to React as a "framework", we're working with that colloquial understanding.
React's primary goal is to minimize the bugs that occur when developers are building UIs. It does this through the use of components — self-contained, logical 
pieces of code that describe a portion of the user interface. These components can be composed together to create a full UI, and React abstracts away much of the 
rendering work, leaving you to concentrate on the UI design.

React utilizes features of modern JavaScript for many of its patterns. Its biggest departure from JavaScript comes with the use of JSX syntax. JSX extends JavaScript's
syntax so that HTML-like code can live alongside it
