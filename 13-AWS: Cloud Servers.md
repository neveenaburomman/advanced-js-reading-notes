# Amazon Web Services(AWS)

Amazon Web Services(AWS) => is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, 
and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing web services provide a variety of basic abstract technical infrastructure and 
distributed computing building blocks and tools. One of these services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal 
a virtual cluster of computers, available all the time, through the Internet. AWS's virtual computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer,
including hardware central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing; local/RAM memory; hard-disk/SSD storage; a choice of 
operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, and customer relationship management (CRM).


The AWS technology is implemented at server farms throughout the world, and maintained by the Amazon subsidiary. Fees are based on a combination of
usage (known as a "Pay-as-you-go" model), hardware, operating system, software, or networking features chosen by the subscriber required availability, 
redundancy, security, and service options. Subscribers can pay for a single virtual AWS computer, a dedicated physical computer, or clusters of either.
As part of the subscription agreement , Amazon provides security for subscribers' systems. AWS operates from many global geographical regions including 6 
in North America.
