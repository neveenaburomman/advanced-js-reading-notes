## Redux Middleware 
It provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer. People use Redux middleware for logging, 
crash reporting, talking to an asynchronous API, routing, and more.

## Using Middleware to Enable Async Logic
the next examples will show  how middleware can enable us to write some kind of async logic that interacts with the Redux store.
One possibility is writing a middleware that looks for specific action types, and runs async logic when it sees those actions, like these examples:
```
import { client } from '../api/client'

const delayedActionMiddleware = storeAPI => next => action => {
  if (action.type === 'todos/todoAdded') {
    setTimeout(() => {
      // Delay this action by one second
      next(action)
    }, 1000)
    return
  }

  return next(action)
}

const fetchTodosMiddleware = storeAPI => next => action => {
  if (action.type === 'todos/fetchTodos') {
    // Make an API call to fetch todos from the server
    client.get('todos').then(todos => {
      // Dispatch an action with the todos we received
      storeAPI.dispatch({ type: 'todos/todosLoaded', payload: todos })
    })
  }

  return next(action)
}
```

## Writing an Async Function Middleware
Here's what that middleware might look like:

Example async function middleware
```
const asyncFunctionMiddleware = storeAPI => next => action => {
  // If the "action" is actually a function instead...
  if (typeof action === 'function') {
    // then call the function and pass `dispatch` and `getState` as arguments
    return action(storeAPI.dispatch, storeAPI.getState)
  }

  // Otherwise, it's a normal action - send it onwards
  return next(action)
}
```
And then we could use that middleware like this:
```
const middlewareEnhancer = applyMiddleware(asyncFunctionMiddleware)
const store = createStore(rootReducer, middlewareEnhancer)

// Write a function that has `dispatch` and `getState` as arguments
const fetchSomeData = (dispatch, getState) => {
  // Make an async HTTP request
  client.get('todos').then(todos => {
    // Dispatch an action with the todos we received
    dispatch({ type: 'todos/todosLoaded', payload: todos })
    // Check the updated store state after dispatching
    const allTodos = getState().todos
    console.log('Number of todos after loading: ', allTodos.length)
  })
}
```
// Pass the _function_ we wrote to `dispatch`
store.dispatch(fetchSomeData)
// logs: 'Number of todos after loading: ###'


## Redux Async Data Flow
Just like with a normal action, we first need to handle a user event in the application, such as a click on a button. Then, we call dispatch(), and pass in
something, whether it be a plain action object, a function, or some other value that a middleware can look for.
Once that dispatched value reaches a middleware, it can make an async call, and then dispatch a real action object when the async call completes.
 When we add async logic to a Redux app, we add an extra step where middleware can run logic like AJAX requests, then dispatch actions. 


## Using the Redux Thunk Middleware
Redux already has an official version of that "async function middleware", called the Redux "Thunk" middleware. The thunk middleware allows us to write functions
that get dispatch and getState as arguments. The thunk functions can have any async logic we want inside, and that logic can dispatch actions and read the store 
state as needed.
