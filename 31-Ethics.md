## The ethical dilemmas of self-driving cars

Self-driving cars will introduce new forms of human control. Not having to own a vehicle and hiring one only when it's needed will itself be a major new form – one 
that will likely give many people more control over their monthly finances. Passengers are also likely to have more choice over vehicle settings, preferences and routes,
not to mention what they do while they're in the car.
Cefkin likens the uncertainty over self-driving cars to the angst that accompanied cellphones when they first arrived.
"People felt like they weren't as much in control as to when they communicated with people, but we adapted," she says. "That feeling itself is socially 
constructed and there will be some replacement feeling of control in the future, it just won't look the way it does today."
