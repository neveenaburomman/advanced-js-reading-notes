# Securing Passwords
The bcrypt hashing function allows us to build a password security platform that scales with computation power and always hashes every password with a salt.

# Basic access authentication
basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser) to provide a user name and password when making a request. In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field in the form of Authorization: Basic <credentials>, where credentials is the Base64 encoding of ID and password joined by a single colon :.


# Review, Research, and Discussion

- **singleton** is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance. It contains static variables that can accommodate unique and private instances of itself.
- Singletons are used to create an instance of a class if it does not exist or else return the reference of the existing one. This means that singletons are created exactly once during the runtime of the application in the global scope.

# Document the following Vocabulary Terms

Router Middleware : it is a piece of code that comes in the middle of request and response
Dynamic Module Loading : Dynamic loading is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library (or other binary) into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from memory.

Singleton Pattern :  the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance.
