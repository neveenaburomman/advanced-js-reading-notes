## React Native
React Native is an open-source UI software framework created by Meta Platforms, Inc. It is used to develop applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS,
tvOS, Web, Windows and UWP by enabling developers to use the React framework along with native platform capabilities

## Native Components
In Android development, you write views in Kotlin or Java; in iOS development, you use Swift or Objective-C. With React Native, you can invoke these views with JavaScript
using React components. At runtime, React Native creates the corresponding Android and iOS views for those components. Because React Native components are backed by the
same views as Android and iOS, React Native apps look, feel, and perform like any other apps. We call these platform-backed components Native Components.

React Native comes with a set of essential, ready-to-use Native Components you can use to start building your app today. These are React Native's Core Components.
- React Native also lets you build your own Native Components for Android and iOS to suit your appâ€™s unique needs. We also have a thriving ecosystem of these 
community-contributed components. Check out Native Directory to find what the community has been creating.
## Core Components
React Native has many Core Components for everything from form controls to activity indicators. You can find them all documented in the API section. You will 
mostly work with the following Core Components:
