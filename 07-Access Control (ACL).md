# Access Control (ACL)

## Role-based access control
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of restricting network access based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. RBAC ensures employees access only 
information they need to do their jobs and prevents them from accessing information that doesn't pertain to them.

is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges. The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role 
relationships make it simple to perform user assignments. A study by NIST has demonstrated that RBAC addresses many needs ofcommercial and government organizations
RBAC can be used to facilitate administration of security in large organizations with hundreds of users and thousands of permissions.Although RBAC is 
different from MAC and DAC access control frameworks, it can enforce these policies without any complication.


**Access control lists (ACL)** => An ACL is a means of defining access rights by a given user or user group, to a specific object, such as a document.
As a simple example, an ACL could be used to allow users from one department to make changes to a document, while only allowing users from other departments to read
the document.
**Attribute-based access control (ABAC)** => ABAC, sometimes known as policy-based access control, can use a variety of attributes, including user department, time of
day, location of access, type of access required, etc. to determine whether a user’s access request should be granted.Both of these options provide additional 
granularity of controls beyond the basic concept of RBAC, but can also greatly expand the effort required to create and maintain the necessary permissions.  
RBAC arguably offers a more simplified and manageable approach, given that the privileges of a user in a given position are granted with a simple effort,
to all others in the same role.  These methods can, however, be used in tandem to increase control.

## RBAC vs. ABAC vs. ACL


# Review, Research, and Discussion
1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
**Basic authentication**transmits credentials as user ID/password pairs, encoded using base64. The client sends HTTP requests with the Authorization header
that contains the word Basic word followed by a space and a base64-encoded string username:password.
**Bearer authentication** (also called token authentication) has security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access 
to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request.

2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?
used to share security information between two parties — a client and a server

# Vocabulary Terms
encryption => is the process of encoding information
token =>  is a single element of a programming language. There are 5 token categories : Reserved words ,Operators ,Identifiers ,Constants ,Separators
bearer => is normally some kind of opaque value created by the authentication server
JSON Web Token => is a proposed Internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds 
JSON that asserts some number of claims.
